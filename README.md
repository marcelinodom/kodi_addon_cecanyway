# kodi_addon_cecanyway
Addon for Kodi that launches the cecanyway application (<a href="https://github.com/mkulke/cecanyway">https://github.com/mkulke/cecanyway</a>) as a service in a Raspberry Pi.
It is necessary to disable CEC in Kodi options. The addon includes the binary (Resources/cecanyway) compiled in a Raspberry Pi although it also works in a Raspberry Pi 2.<br/>
In the file Resources/cecanyway.conf is possible to configure more keycodes.<br/>
